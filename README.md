# Travel
This is a java project that uses a GUI created with JavaFx to take a file entered by the user and organizes the data that is in that file. This project took an input in the form of a txt file with information on a trip like location,  cost,  days, distance, and information on the actual travel, the txt file is grabbed by inputting the file name into the GUI. The program would take this data and then organize it into different arrays based on the mode of travel and then display it in the GUI. The GUI would have different buttons to call different classes and methods to display certain information. Working on this program allowed me my first taste of having to program a GUI and using an unfamiliar program, but by researching how to use JavaFX and implementing it in my program I was able to finish the program and fine-tune it so that it could be used by anyone.
